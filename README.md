# Emacs Centered Point

Emacs Centered point is a very simple elisp file that will recenter the cursor every time that it moves. There exist other packages, but this is the simplest by far. The downside to this approach of simplicity is that emacs may redraw the screen when the cursor is moved and it will lead to many forced redraws.
